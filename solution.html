        <p>We at Urban CROPS have come up with 3 solutions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rely more on Urban Farming</li>

        <p>We believe that an increased focus on urban farming can help us combat the economic hit of the COVID-19 pandemic, by creating new, environmentally conscious and sustainable jobs. 
            This solution allows us to simultaneously revert our political gaze back to the climate and environment, while also helping the economy. <a class="source1" href="./sources.html#sourcebenefits"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            <br>
            Our secondary goal is to fulfill the needs of the urban poor, by providing better and easier access to healthy, organic produce for users. <a class="source1" href="./sources.html#sourcegreenroof"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            <br>
            The aim of our app is to create a reliable center for urban farming, not only in-between farmers, but also for consumers and investors. So  it is available for everyone can to use it.
